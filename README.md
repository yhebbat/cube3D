**Introduction**

Welcome to the cub3d project, a 3D representation of a cube created using the C programming language and the MLX library. This project was completed as part of the curriculum at 42 Network, and is designed to demonstrate your skills in computer graphics and game design.

**Objectives**

The objective of this project is to create a 3D representation of a cube, complete with lighting and shading effects, using the C programming language and the MLX library. You will also be required to implement key functionalities such as camera movement, user interaction and object collision detection.

Design and Development
The design of the cub3d project was based on the following key considerations:

Simple, efficient and scalable code structure
User-friendly interface and controls
Real-time rendering of the 3D cube and its environment
The development of the cub3d project was done using the C programming language and the MLX library. The MLX library provides a range of functions for creating and manipulating graphics, while the C programming language was used to structure the code and implement the key algorithms and data structures required for the project.
